# YSI-QC-code-stuff

This repo is for sharing R scripts that bring in YSI data dowloaded into csv files. 

If you are planning on beginning to collect the data via the instrument, you will need to:
-put each site name in as you go or ahead of time.
-once you have data saved in the handheld unit, you'll need to download the KorDSS software off of YSI's website (Xylem is the parent company).
-you may need to use the YSI cord specifically to connect the unit to a computer, I think it might depend on instrument, but they are around $20, and you can order them online from Xylem or Fondriest.
-Once you have the cord and the software downloaded, connect the YSI handheld to the PC via the micro USB connection on the top of the unit. Launch the software then power on the handheld unit. Then click “Connect” in the right hand pane. The software will automatically download all new data and check the instruments on the unit.
-To view and export the data, click the “View Data” tab at the top, then select “Search” just below that. You will then enter your search parameters to include just the data you need, then click “Accept". You will see the data plotted in Kor. You can then Export to CSV by clicking “Export to CSV” next to where you clicked “Search” in the last step.
